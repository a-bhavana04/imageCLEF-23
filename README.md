# ImageCLEF 2023: Quality Control of Synthetic Medical Images via GANs

## Overview
This project addresses the **ImageCLEF 2023 Medical Task** of identifying the "fingerprints" of real images in synthetic biomedical images created by GANs. The objective is to classify synthetic images based on whether they were derived from specific real images and assess the relationship between real and synthetic datasets.

---

## Features
- **Dataset Analysis**: Analysis of real and synthetic lung CT images to detect fingerprints.
- **Model Implementations**:
  - **CNN Model**: Classifies images as "used" or "unused" in GAN training.
  - **SIFT + KNN Model**: Uses keypoint detection and feature matching for classification.
  - **Image Hashing**: Perceptual hashing (pHash) for mapping real images to synthetic counterparts.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models on F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Lung CT axial slices of 256Ã—256 pixels.
- **Composition**:
  - 500 synthetic images.
  - 160 real images (used and unused for GAN training).
  - Test dataset with 10,000 synthetic and 200 real images.
