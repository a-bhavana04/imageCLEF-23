# Controlling the Quality of Synthetic Medical Images Created via GANs
ImageCLEF 2023  
The analysis performed was to identify the used and unused images from a set of real medical images that were used to synthesize GAN images. 
This was done using two approaches : CNN and SIFT infused KNN. Image hashing techniques were further used to cross verify the final outcomes of these models.
